Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

If I don't call you that means I ain't tryna be on your shit
Even though I'm on your shit
And if I ignore you
Don't take it as me being rude
It just means I have things to do
I know these (?) like to (?)
I know so (?) go for it
If I don't text back shit
That just means I have something to say
And I ain't want you reading that anyway
Girl you need to relax
You know I fuck with you the long way
So you don't have to go (?)

Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Check up on me girl
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Ever since (?)

Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind

If you don't call me, shit
I'ma turn to pretty drama
Cause I'ma think that you moved on
But if you stalk me
It's all good but that's a fact
I'm never gonna call you back

Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Check up on me girl
Just call me a little
Just call me a little bit
Ever since (?)

Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind
Out of sight, out of mind, out of sight, out of mind
I do know that
Out of sight, out of mind, I'm still on your mind

I'll be (?) your motel (?)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Even when (?) you got on your tongue
(?)
