I'm not insane, I'm not bummed out
I got no one to blame, nothin' to change
I got no evil to fight
One thing's for sure, I'm all outta angst
Society don't bother me
And there's something wrong with that
I'm off to Pakistan, learn the laws of Islam
And fundamentalism, forget that rock n' roll
No cigarettes, no drink
In fact it's difficult to think about getting laid
When you don't even get to see her face
I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not liquored up
I got nothin' to do, nothin' to lose
I got no place to call home
One thing's for sure, I'm all outta angst
Society don't bother me
And there's something wrong with that
Next stop, Mongolia
Don't get to golf, or fuck, or bowl with ya
Throw out that handy cam
No stepping out till spring
In fact it's difficult to sing when it's 20 below
And that's during the day, I'm not insane
I'm not insane
I'm not insane
