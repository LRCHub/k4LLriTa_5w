Good morning happy dreamer
And tell me how are you
Feet on the ground
Just called to say
'I'm in the mood'

My car's parked out on the driveway
Are you free this afternoon
'Cos it's in need of attention
So I'll drop by would that be cool

The way that you do
What you want me to do
Makes me feel alright
The way that you drum me
The way that you bass me
It's outta sight
Outta sight
Outta sight

I don't believe in wasting
My time, so I'll move fast
This dream machine
Was built to last

So cruise on down my main street
'Cos I got nothing to hide
And polish up your engine
We're heading for overdrive

The way that you do
What you want me to do
Makes me feel alright
The way that you drum me
The way that you bass me
It's outta sight
Outta sight
Outta sight

My car's parked out on the driveway
Are you free this afternoon
'Cos it's in need of attention
So I'll drop by would that be cool

The way that you do
What you want me to do
Makes me feel alright
The way that you drum me
The way that you bass me
It's outta sight
Outta sight
Outta sight
