TAKE ME HOME
DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL
WHEN I'M ALL ALONE
I'M INVISIBLE
YOU DON'T CARE AT ALL
DON'T BLINK, DON'T STARE
WHEN I'M HERE, YOU'RE THERE
TAKE ME HOME
CAN WE JUST PRETEND
IT'LL NEVER END
FOR YOU I DON'T WANNA BE JUST ANOTHER LOVER
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIVE YOUR HEART BACK
I'M GIVING UP ON ALL MY DEMONS
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THEIR FEELINGS
THEY STRING ME ALONG AND I DON'T BELONG
OUT OF SIGHT
OUT OF MIND
I'M GIVING UP ON ALL MY DEMONS
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THEIR FEELINGS
THEY STRING ME ALONG AND I DON'T BELONG
OUT OF SIGHT
OUT OF MIND
USED TO GIVE ME EVERYTHING I NEEDED
TILL I NEEDED SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN
WHEN YOU SAID FOREVER GUESS YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT
LYING TO MY FACE AND NOW I SEE IT (YEA)
DON'T BLINK DON'T STARE
WHEN YOU'RE STANDING HERE, ARE YOU REALLY THERE?
WHEN THE RAIN IS GONE, ARE YOU MOVING ON?
CAUSE I'M HOLDING ON TO YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIVE YOUR HEART BACK
I'M GIVING UP ON ALL MY DEMONS
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THEIR FEELINGS
THEY STRING ME ALOHG AND I DON'T BELONG
OUT OF SIGHT
OUT OF MIND
I'M GIVING UP ON ALL MY DEMONS
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THEIR FEELINGS
THEY STRING ME ALONG AND I DON'T BELONG
OUT OF SIGHT
OUT OF MIND
(DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIVE YOUR HEART BACK)
I'M GIVING UP ON ALL MY DEMONS
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THEIR FEELINGS
THEY STRING ME ALONG AND I DON'T BELONG
OUT OF SIGHT
OUT OF MIND
I'M GIVING UP ON ALL MY DEMONS
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALL THEIR FEELNGS
THEY STRING ME ALONG AND I DON'T BELONG
OUT OF SIGHT
OUT OF MIND
I'M GIVING UP
